**Deprecated**: This is ancient and should be ignored. I simply rescued it from Google Code before it was deleted.

Many years ago I did a series of posts on doing the same game another fellow was doing with PHP using Ruby on Rails instead: http://johnmunsch.com/2008/08/13/building-browser-games-an-overview

This is an antique from that era. There's pretty much nothing I would do the same way anymore, the same thing could be done with
much more easily today than seven years ago so please don't take anything here as a recommendation or even a suggestion. It's just
here because Google Code was shutting down and I had to move it or it was gone for good. I'll try to go back and update the blog
post with a pointer to this so it doesn't end up broken.
